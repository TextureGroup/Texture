		<p>Texture is an iOS framework built on top of UIKit that keeps even the most complex user interfaces smooth and responsive. It was originally built to make Facebook&#39;s Paper possible, and goes hand-in-hand with <a href="https://github.com/facebook/pop">pop</a>&#39;s physics-based animations &mdash; but it&#39;s just as powerful with UIKit Dynamics and conventional app designs. More recently, it was used to power Pinterest's <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/pinterest-reinvents-prove-really-worth-billions/">app rewrite</a>.</p>

		<p>As the framework has grown, many features have been added that can save developers tons of time by eliminating common boilerplate style structures common in modern iOS apps. If you've ever dealt with cell reuse bugs, tried to performantly preload data for a page or scroll style interface or even just tried to keep your app from dropping too many frames you can benefit from integrating Texture.</p>
