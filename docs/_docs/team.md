# Join us!

We are looking for senior developers familiar with Texture to join our team! 

We have an exciting roadmap that we believe will continue to push the boundaries of what is possible on the iOS platform, while making the framework easier to use than ever before.

As part of the team, you would work on Texture, [PINRemoteImage](https://github.com/pinterest/PINRemoteImage), and [PINCache](https://github.com/pinterest/PINCache) (the backing store for ASNetworkImageNode), while using all three in Pinterest's [app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pinterest/id429047995). 

One interesting thing to note is that Pinterest does not have an internal fork of Texture. Everything is developed on master, with release branches cut from master only a few weeks before our public application launches. This allows us to move exceptionally quickly in developing and launching improvements to millions of users.

Sound interesting? 
Send us an email at textureframework@gmail.com.
