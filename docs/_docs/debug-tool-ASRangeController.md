## Visualize ASRangeController tuning parameters <a href="https://github.com/facebook/AsyncDisplayKit/pull/1390">(PR #1390)</a> 
<br>
This debug feature adds a semi-transparent subview in the bottom right hand corner of the sharedApplication keyWindow that visualizes the ASRangeTuningParameters per each ASLayoutRangeType for each visible (on-screen) instance of ASRangeController. 

- The instances of ASRangeController are represented as bars
- As you scroll around within ASTable/CollectionViews you can see the parameters (green = Visible, yellow = Display, and red = FetchData) move relative to each other. 
- White arrows on the L and R sides of the individual RangeController bar views indicate the scrolling direction so that you can determine the leading / trailing tuning parameters (especially useful for vertically-oriented rangeControllers whose leading edge might be unclear within the horizontally-oriented bar view). 
- The white debug label above the RangeController bar displays the RangeController dataSource’s class name to differentiate between nested views.
- The overlay can be moved with a panning gesture in order to see content under it.

This debug feature is useful for highly optimized Texture apps that require tuning of any ASRangeController. Or for anyone who is curious about how ASRangeControllers work. 

The <a href="https://github.com/texturegroup/texture/tree/master/examples/VerticalWithinHorizontalScrolling">VerticalWithinHorizontal example app</a> contains an ASPagerNode with embedded ASTableViews. In the screenshot with this feature enabled, you can see the two range controllers - ASTableView and ASCollectionView (ASPagerNode) - in the overlay. 

- The white arrows to the right of the rangeController bars indicate that the user is currently scrolling down through the table and right through the ASCollectionView/PagerNode. 
- The ASTableView rangeController bar indicates that the range parameters are tuned to both fetch and decode more data in the downward table direction rather than in the reverse direction (which makes sense as the user is scrolling down). 
- Since it’s less obvious whether or not the user will page to the right or left next, the ASCollectionView is tuned to fetch and decode equal amounts of data in each direction. 
- In the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1BArZ05bNhzVy1jSW9FeEVXUjg/view">video demo</a>, you can see as the user scrolls between pages, that new ASTableView rangeControllers are created and removed in the overlay view.

## Limitations
<ul>
  <li>only shows onscreen ASRangeControllers</li>
  <li>currently the ratio of red (fetch data), yellow (display) and green (visible) are relative to each other, but not between each bar view. So you cannot compare individual bars to eachother</li>
</ul>

## Usage
In your `AppDelegate.m` file, 
<ul>
  <li>import <code>AsyncDisplayKit+Debug.h</code></li>
  <li>add <code>[ASDisplayNode setShouldShowRangeDebugOverlay:YES]</code> at the top of your AppDelegate's <code>didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code> method</li>
</ul>

**Make sure to call this method before initializing any component that uses an ASRangeControllers (ASTableView, ASCollectionView).**
