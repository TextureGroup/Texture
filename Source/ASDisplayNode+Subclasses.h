/**
 * The subclass header _ASDisplayNode+Subclasses_ defines the following methods that either must or can be overriden by
 * subclasses of ASDisplayNode.
 *
 * These methods should never be called directly by other classes.
 *
 * ## Drawing
 *
 * Implement one of +displayWithParameters:isCancelled: or +drawRect:withParameters:isCancelled: to provide
 * drawing for your node.
 *
 * Use -drawParametersForAsyncLayer: to copy any properties that are involved in drawing into an immutable object for
 * use on the display queue. The display and drawRect implementations *MUST* be thread-safe, as they can be called on
 * the displayQueue (asynchronously) or the main thread (synchronously/displayImmediately).
 *
 * Class methods that require passing in copies of the values are used to minimize the need for locking around instance
 * variable access, and the possibility of the asynchronous display pass grabbing an inconsistent state across multiple
 * variables.

/**
 * @abstract Return the calculated layout.
 *
 * @discussion For node subclasses that implement manual layout (e.g., they have a custom -layout method), 
 * calculatedLayout may be accessed on subnodes to retrieved cached information about their size.  
 * This allows -layout to be very fast, saving time on the main thread.  
 * Note: .calculatedLayout will only be set for nodes that have had -layoutThatFits: called on them.
 * For manual layout, make sure you call -layoutThatFits: in your implementation of -calculateSizeThatFits:.
 *
 * For node subclasses that use automatic layout (e.g., they implement -layoutSpecThatFits:), 
 * it is typically not necessary to use .calculatedLayout at any point.  For these nodes, 
 * the ASLayoutSpec implementation will automatically call -layoutThatFits: on all of the subnodes,
 * and the ASDisplayNode base class implementation of -layout will automatically make use of .calculatedLayout on the subnodes.
 *
 * @return Layout that wraps calculated size returned by -calculateSizeThatFits: (in manual layout mode),
 * or layout already calculated from layout spec returned by -layoutSpecThatFits: (in automatic layout mode).
 *
 * @warning Subclasses must not override this; it returns the last cached layout and is never expensive.
