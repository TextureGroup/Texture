/**
 * The subclass header _ASDisplayNode+Subclasses_ defines the following methods that either must or can be overriden by
 * subclasses of ASDisplayNode.
 *
 * These methods should never be called directly by other classes.
 *
 * ## Drawing
 *
 * Implement one of +displayWithParameters:isCancelled: or +drawRect:withParameters:isCancelled: to provide
 * drawing for your node.
 *
 * Use -drawParametersForAsyncLayer: to copy any properties that are involved in drawing into an immutable object for
 * use on the display queue. The display and drawRect implementations *MUST* be thread-safe, as they can be called on
 * the displayQueue (asynchronously) or the main thread (synchronously/displayImmediately).
 *
 * Class methods that require passing in copies of the values are used to minimize the need for locking around instance
 * variable access, and the possibility of the asynchronous display pass grabbing an inconsistent state across multiple
 * variables.
