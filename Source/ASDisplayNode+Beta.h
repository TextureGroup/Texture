 * @discussion
 * When called, causes all descendent nodes' contents to be drawn directly into this node's layer's backing
 * store.
 *
 * If a node's descendants are static (never animated or never change attributes after creation) then that node is a
 * good candidate for rasterization.  Rasterizing descendants has two main benefits:
 * 1) Backing stores for descendant layers are not created.  Instead the layers are drawn directly into the rasterized
 * container.  This can save a great deal of memory.
 * 2) Since the entire subtree is drawn into one backing store, compositing and blending are eliminated in that subtree
 * which can help improve animation/scrolling/etc performance.
 *
 * Rasterization does not currently support descendants with transform, sublayerTransform, or alpha. Those properties
 * will be ignored when rasterizing descendants.
 *
 * Note: this has nothing to do with -[CALayer shouldRasterize], which doesn't work with ASDisplayNode's asynchronous
 * rendering model.
 *
 * Note: You cannot add subnodes whose layers/views are already loaded to a rasterized node.
 * Note: You cannot call this method after the receiver's layer/view is loaded.
