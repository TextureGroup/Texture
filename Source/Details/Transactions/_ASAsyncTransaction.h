/**
 @summary ASAsyncTransaction provides lightweight transaction semantics for asynchronous operations.

 @desc ASAsyncTransaction provides the following properties:

 - Transactions group an arbitrary number of operations, each consisting of an execution block and a completion block.
 - The execution block returns a single object that will be passed to the completion block.
 - Execution blocks added to a transaction will run in parallel on the global background dispatch queues;
   the completion blocks are dispatched to the callback queue.
 - Every operation completion block is guaranteed to execute, regardless of cancelation.
   However, execution blocks may be skipped if the transaction is canceled.
 - Operation completion blocks are always executed in the order they were added to the transaction, assuming the
   callback queue is serial of course.
