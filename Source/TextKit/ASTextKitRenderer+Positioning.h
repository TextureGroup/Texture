 Measure options are used to specify which type of line height measurement to use.

 ASTextNodeRendererMeasureOptionLineHeight is faster and will give the height from the baseline to the next line.

 ASTextNodeRendererMeasureOptionCapHeight is a more nuanced measure of the glyphs in the given range that attempts to
 produce a visually balanced rectangle above and below the glyphs to produce nice looking text highlights.

 ASTextNodeRendererMeasureOptionBlock uses the cap height option to generate each glyph index, but combines all but the
 first and last line rect into a single block.  Looks nice for multiline selection.

 block is given the character index that corresponds to the glyph at each index in question, as well as the bounding
 rect for that glyph.

 @discussion Glyph location based on a touch point is not an exact science because user touches are not well-represented
 by a simple point, especially in the context of link-heavy text.  So we have this method to make it a bit easier.  This
 method checks a grid of candidate positions around the touch point you give it, and computes the bounding rect of the
 glyph corresponding to the character index given.

 The bounding rect of the glyph can be used to identify the best glyph index that corresponds to your touch.  For
 instance, comparing centroidal distance from the glyph bounding rect to the touch center is useful for identifying
 which link a user actually intended to select.
