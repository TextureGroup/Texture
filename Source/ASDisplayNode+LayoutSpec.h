 * @return A block that takes a constrainedSize ASSizeRange argument, and must return an ASLayoutSpec that includes all
 * of the subnodes to position in the layout. This input-output relationship is identical to the subclass override
 * method -layoutSpecThatFits:
 *
 * @warning Subclasses that implement -layoutSpecThatFits: must not also use .layoutSpecBlock. Doing so will trigger
 * an exception. A future version of the framework may support using both, calling them serially, with the
 * .layoutSpecBlock superseding any values set by the method override.

 * is used to calculate an ASLayout and cached by ASDisplayNode for quick access during -layout. Other expensive work that needs to
 * be done before display can be performed here, and using ivars to cache any valuable intermediate results is
 * encouraged.
