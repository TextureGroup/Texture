 * This mode is useful for applications that are debugging issues with their collection view implementation. 
 * In particular, some applications do not properly conform to the API requirement of UICollectionView, and these 
 * applications may experience difficulties with ASCollectionView. Providing this mode allows for developers to 
 * work towards resolving technical debt in their collection view data source, while ramping up asynchronous 
 * collection layout.
 *
 * NOTE: Because this mode results in expensive operations like cell layout being performed on the main thread, 
 * it should be used as a tool to resolve data source conformance issues with Apple collection view API.
