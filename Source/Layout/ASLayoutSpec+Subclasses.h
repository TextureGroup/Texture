 * {
 *   ASInsetLayoutSpec *insetSpec = [[ASInsetLayoutSpec alloc] init];
 *   insetSpec.insets = UIEdgeInsetsMake(10,10,10,10);

 * Adds a child with the given identifier to this layout spec.

 *
 * @discussion Every ASLayoutSpec must act on at least one child. The ASLayoutSpec base class takes the
 * responsibility of holding on to the spec children. Some layout specs, like ASInsetLayoutSpec,
 * only require a single child.
 *
 * For layout specs that require a known number of children (ASBackgroundLayoutSpec, for example)
 * a subclass can use the setChild method to set the "primary" child. It should then use this method
 * to set any other required children. Ideally a subclass would hide this from the user, and use the
 * setChild:forIndex: internally. For example, ASBackgroundLayoutSpec exposes a backgroundChild
 * property that behind the scenes is calling setChild:forIndex:.
