/**
 A layout spec that wraps another layoutElement child, applying insets around it.

 If the child has a size specified as a fraction, the fraction is resolved against this spec's parent
 size **after** applying insets.

 @example ASOuterLayoutSpec contains an ASInsetLayoutSpec with an ASInnerLayoutSpec. Suppose that:
 - ASOuterLayoutSpec is 200pt wide.
 - ASInnerLayoutSpec specifies its width as 100%.
 - The ASInsetLayoutSpec has insets of 10pt on every side.
 ASInnerLayoutSpec will have size 180pt, not 200pt, because it receives a parent size that has been adjusted for insets.

 If you're familiar with CSS: ASInsetLayoutSpec's child behaves similarly to "box-sizing: border-box".

 An infinite inset is resolved as an inset equal to all remaining space after applying the other insets and child size.
 @example An ASInsetLayoutSpec with an infinite left inset and 10px for all other edges will position it's child 10px from the right edge.
